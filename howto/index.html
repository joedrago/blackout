            <span class="header">Summary / Objective:</span><br>
            <blockquote>
              Blackout is a trick-taking card game similar to Spades, played over a series of rounds, with each round having a series of tricks.
              <br><br>
              The objective of the regular game is to have the *lowest* score at the end of the rounds. The objective of Marathon mode is to see how many rounds you can last without ever scoring a point.
              <br><br>
              The amount of rounds and tricks per round is decided when the game is created, and each round can have a differing number of tricks. For example, "3 to 13" means to play 11 rounds, with the first round having 3 tricks, and the last round having 13 tricks. The preferred trick size is 13 in a 4 player game, as it uses all of the cards, which offers the most opportunity for strategy.

            <blockquote>
              When the game begins, a dealer is chosen at random. After cards are dealt, everyone must bid, starting to the left of the dealer. The <span class="hl">bid</span> is a guess of how many of the cards in your hand will earn you a trick. Once everyone has bid, the player holding the lowest club begins by throwing it to begin the first trick.
              <br><br>
              A <span class="hl">trick</span> is created when every player throws a single card into the pile. One of the cards will earn/"win" that trick for its owner, which is tallied until the end of the round. When the round ends, each player earns <span class="hlbad">penalty points</span> based on how far off their bid was from the number of tricks they actually won.

            <blockquote>
              The first card thrown for each trick sets the trick's <span class="hl">suit</span>, which is key to deciding which card wins the trick. The highest card (Ace high) matching the trick's suit will win the trick, unless a <span class="hl">trump card</span> (any spade) is played, which always beats the trick's suit. Any suit other than the trick's suit (suit that started the trick) or the trump suit (spades) is considered a <span class="hl">dump</span>. Dump cards are guaranteed losers regardless of value, which is often desirable to make sure you only win the amount of tricks that you bid.
              <br><br>
              For example, say the first card thrown was an 8 of diamonds. If the next card thrown was a 3 of spades, it would "claim" the trick (become the tentative winner). If the third card thrown was a 7 of spades, it'd claim the trick over the earlier, lower spade. And if the last card was a king of clubs, it would be considered a dump as it isn't a diamond or spade. The player who threw the 7 of spades would win the trick.

            <span class="header">Rules and Strategy</span><br>
            <blockquote>
              Blackout relies on the concept of <span class="hl">forced play</span> for most of its strategy. In many situations, the rules will only allow you to choose from a couple of cards in your hand. The strategy comes from the fact that your opponents are bound by the same rules. Most of the time, the goal is to force your opponents to throw the card you've guessed they have (based on their bid, current number of tricks won, and remaining cards), in order to force a trick to go to a specific player.
              <br><br>
              For the <i>first</i> card in a trick (referred to as <span class="hl">leading the trick</span>), the only rule is that you cannot lead with a spade unless a spade has already trumped a previous trick this round ("<span class="hl">trump broken</span>"). Remember, the first card of a trick sets the <span class="hl">trick's suit</span>.
              <br><br>
              For all other cards, you must satisfy two rules:
              <br>
              <ol>
                <li>You must play a card matching the trick's suit, if possible.</li>
                <li>If are forced to throw the trick's suit (see rule #1) and card claiming the trick also matches the trick's suit, you must play a higher value than that card, if possible.</li>
              </ol>
              Note that these rules only apply if you have a card matching the trick's suit. If you don't have <i>any</i> of the trick's suit, every card in your hand is a legal play (no matter how poor of a play it might be).

            <span class="header">Examples</span><br>
            <blockquote>
              <ul>
                <li>Opponent leads with a 10D, and you have no diamonds. All cards in your hand are legal plays. All spades claim the trick, all others dump/lose.</li>
                <li>Opponent leads with a 6S, and you don't have any spades. All plays are legal, and guaranteed to lose.</li>
                <li>Opponent leads with a 7H, and you have two hearts: 4H and 10H. Based on Rule #1, you must throw one of these two. Based on Rule #2, you must throw the 10H, as the current claim is a heart, which matches the trick's suit.</li>
                <li>Opponent leads with a 7H, next opponent trumps with a 4S. You have two hearts: 4H and 10H. Based on Rule #1, you must throw one of these two. However, since the current claim is by the 4S (which is not the trick's suit), you are not bound by Rule #2 and can throw either the 4H or the 10H.</li>
                <li>Opponent leads with a 7 of hearts, next opponent trumps with a 4 of spades. You have two hearts: 4 and 10. Based on Rule #1, you must throw one of these two. However, since the current claim is by the 4 of spades (which is not the trick's suit), you are not bound by Rule #2 and can throw either the 4 or the 10.</li>
                <li>You only have spades left, but nobody has broken trump by throwing a spade this round yet. Throw any card.</li>
              </ul>
